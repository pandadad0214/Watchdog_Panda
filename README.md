# Watchdog_Panda# 🛡️ Watchdog Panda Documentation Index

Watchdog Panda is the **resilience guardian** of the Panda Federation, responsible for keeping key AI processes alive and recovering from crashes.

---

## 🧭 Overview

- Purpose: Uptime, resilience, and recovery  
- Scope: Monitoring, restarting, and eventually notifying  
- Environment: Termux / Linux‑like systems  

---

## 🏗 Architecture

- Core watchdog loop  
- Process detection strategy  
- Restart logic  
- Planned notification hooks  

(Expand these into separate docs as the implementation grows.)

---

## 🧬 Philosophy

- **Minimal but reliable**  
- **Fail‑aware, not fail‑proof**  
- **Composable with other agents**  
- **Transparent behavior**  

Watchdog Panda doesn’t replace observability tools — it provides a simple, local guardian for critical processes.
